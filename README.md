# Lenus
Lenus is a technological solution intended for hotels and which consists in equipping clients and hotel staff with a smart bracelet which will replace the usual plastic bracelet and key in order to be able to monitor access and occupancy of common areas in the hotel in real time.
The solution will be accompanied by a mobile application for customers to interact with the hotel and a web application for hotel managers to improve their services and better meet customer requirements.
Lenus allows :
- Optimizing the physical distance between customers using smart bracelets.
- Managing flows and monitoring congestion in common areas in the hotel in real time.
- Delimiting the epidemic in case of contamination.
- Personalizing and improving the customer experience (Profiling).
- Automate the Check in / Check out process using a terminal to verify customer identity and to accelerate the process.
## Mobile App

The mobile app was developped using Flutter and Spring Boot/Mongo DB.
